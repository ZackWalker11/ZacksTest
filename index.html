<body> So this is a website about me </body>
<p> Once upon a time I owned a liqour store in Michigan called <a href="https://www.hollandsentinel.com/article/20150907/NEWS/150909333">Anchor Party Store</a> in Michigan. 
it was on an inlet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> but owning a liqour store isn't as much fun as it sounds. </p>
<H1> Lake Michigan is beautiful. </h1>

<table border = "1">

            <th>This</th>
            <th>Isn't A</th>
            <th>Very Beautiful</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <th>Website</td>
            <td>I Don't Know</td>
            <td>What To</th>
         </tr>
         
         <tr>
            <th>Put Into</td>
            <td>This Table</td>
            <td>So This Is It</th>
         </tr>
      </table>

<body> And this is my final paragraph. This is definitely not pretty. It's been a while so it took me a minute to remember all the tags. Just have to shake some rust off.</body>
